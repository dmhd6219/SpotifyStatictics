users to explore their music listening habits and statistics in an aesthetically pleasing manner.

## Features

- Attractive visualizations to present the data in an engaging manner
- Easy sharing options to showcase music profiles with friends and social networks

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmhd6219/SpotifyStatictics.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it (optional but recommended):

```bash
cd SpotifyStatictics
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

To run the web application, you will need to set up a Spotify Developer account and obtain the necessary API
credentials. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in with your Spotify
   account.
2. Create a new application and note down the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
3. In the project directory, create a new file named `.env` and add the following lines:

```env
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = 'your_spotify_client_id'
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'your_spotify_client_secret'
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:8080/callback'  # Change this if required
```

Replace `your_spotify_client_id` and `your_spotify_client_secret` with the credentials obtained in step 2.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask development server:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.

3. Click on the "Login with Spotify" button to authenticate using your Spotify account.

4. Once logged in, you'll be able to explore your music profile statistics and visualize your music preferences.
